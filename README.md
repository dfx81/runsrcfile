# RunSrcFile
Tool to compile and run various file in terminal without typing much

Good when working without IDEs in the CLI.

C Version are experimental thus might cause problem.
BAT Version are more stable.

BUGS: PATH problem need to be fixed.

Updates will come when I'm not in the mood of
typing long and tedious commands into CLI.
(mostly git commands)
